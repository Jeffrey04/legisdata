#### About the Github templates
With Github templates, you can have easy readily defined Issue & Push Request templates. These are written using Markdown and some were adapted over from [Gitlab Issue & Merge Request template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/cicd-and-enablement/gitlab/-/tree/master/.gitlab?ref_type=heads). As this repository is a template repository, a new repository can use this repository to get issue & PR template features.

#### How To
Edit the Issue Templates, by editing the relevant Markdown file names in the .gitlab folder and its relevant subfolder [using Markdown syntax rather than .yaml](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms#converting-a-markdown-issue-template-to-a-yaml-issue-form-template).

[.github folder](.github/) can be copied and added/committed into existing repo folder to enable issue & PR template features.
